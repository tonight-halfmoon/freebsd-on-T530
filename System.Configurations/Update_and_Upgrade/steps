  ## Commands to maintaining FreeBSD and system packages update and upgrade


  ### Update & Install packages


  ```
  # portupgrade -ra

  ```
  ### freebsd-update fetch install


  * Follow the steps as described in the official documentation of FreeBSD on System Upgrade.
		And then perhaps you could continue as follows: (at least that what I had to do) 

  ```
  # portsnap fetch update
  # portsnap fetch extract
  # portupgrade -a
  # pkg update && pkg upgrade
  # portmaster -ady --no-confirm
	```

	### Manipulate and fix issues by upgrading adn downgrading
	
	* Read man pkg-static before you consider the following command.
		But in some situations it's helpful to start all over.

	```
  # pkg-static upgrade -f
  ```

	* More

  ````
  # portmaster -aD
  # pkg check -Ba
  # portmaster -a

  ```

  * When something goes wrong with a package then try the following

    * Remove it with portmaster 

    ```
    # portmaster -w -r <package-name>
    ```

    * Remove it with the package manager

    ```
    # pkg remove <package-name>
    ```

        * Example: `pkg remove libXTrap`


    * In case you are not sure about the package name, then search for it

    ```
    # pkg search key
    ```

    * In case the command with optin -r does not work try without it, as follows:

    ```
    # portmaster -w package-name
    ```

    * Find out the reason of failure. If that is because of packages conflict, the deinstall the other package which the cause.
      Sometimes, it may even need to deinstall the package first. Then, try again.

    * Then, to continue the full update. Try with the following

    ```
    # portmaster -afR --no-confirm
    ```


    ```
    # pkg update && pkg upgrade

    ```

  ### Clean up

  ```
  # portmaster --clean-distfiles -y
  # portsclean -C
  # portsclean -DD
  --> to delete many packages at once with regX
  # pkg delete -R '*proto-*'a

  ```

  ### Upgrade certain package 

  ```
  # Upgrade a package
  # portupgrade -R firefox
  ```
